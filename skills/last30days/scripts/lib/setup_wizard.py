I synthesize what people are actually saying right now across social, news, and market sources.

Auto setup gives you the core sources free in about 30 seconds:
- Reddit with comments - free keyless discovery (RSS + shreddit), no API key needed.
- YouTube search + transcripts - installs yt-dlp (open source, 190K+ GitHub stars).
- Digg - trending news, GitHub stars, and pipeline feeds - installs the free, keyless Digg CLI.
- arXiv (papers) + Techmeme (tech-news) - install free, keyless Printing Press CLIs and run on any topic (arXiv is relevance + recency gated to research topics).
- StockTwits - retail trader sentiment - auto-on when your topic is a ticker or crypto (e.g. "$NVDA earnings", "bitcoin"), off for everything else.
- Trustpilot - brand/company review sentiment - opt-in (add trustpilot to INCLUDE_SOURCES), off by default.
- Hacker News + Polymarket + GitHub (auto-on if the gh CLI is installed) - always on, zero config.
- X/Twitter - optional. It stays available when you already configured it, or after you explicitly approve a browser-cookie read; skipping it never blocks research.

Want TikTok and Instagram too? ScrapeCreators adds those (10,000 free calls, scrapecreators.com). No kickbacks, no affiliation.

Power users can turn on more sources in the Manual Setup guide (LinkedIn, Bluesky, Perplexity, and others) - each needs its own credential, so they are off by default."""
