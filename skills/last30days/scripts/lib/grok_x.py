"""X (Twitter) search via the Grok CLI — no X credential of any kind.

The `grok` CLI (https://x.ai/cli) exposes X search tools natively
(`x_keyword_search`, `x_semantic_search`, `x_thread_fetch`, `x_user_search`).
Reaching X through it needs no X account, no browser cookies, and no
`XAI_API_KEY` — only an installed and signed-in `grok`.

Install: curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash   (or npm i -g @xai-official/grok)
Auth:    grok login

Two invocation constraints, both measured, both load-bearing:

* **Never pass `--json-schema`.** Constrained decoding competes with tool use:
  the search silently does not run and the model fills the schema's required
  fields from training data instead. Measured with an interleaved A/B
  controlling for time: plain output returned verified in-window posts on 4 of
  4 calls, `--json-schema` on 1 of 4.
* **Never pass `--tools`.** Two runs produced no output in 7 minutes and were
  killed; the identical prompts without it completed normally.
* **Do pass `--output-format json`.** Grok CLI 1.0.5 narrates tool use and
  then fences a JSON array; the field-block parser treats that as empty
  (``no items parsed``). JSON stdout is the CLI's supported way to skip the
  preamble without constrained decoding. See #1051.

Because retrieval is performed by a language model rather than an API client,
its output can be *confidently wrong* in a way no other backend's can. Every
returned post is therefore validated against the requested window via its
snowflake timestamp before it is allowed into the item flow — see
`_validate_items`. Author matching and schema shape are not sufficient: a
fabricated post carries a plausible handle and a numeric id by construction.
