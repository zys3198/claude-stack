"""Unified `doctor` health surface: aggregate, tier rollup, render (U4).

One command answers "what's broken, what's serving, and what do I run to
fix it" by composing the existing health layers instead of replacing them:

- U1 ``lib/health.py``      dependency probes (ok/missing/broken/timeout)
- U2 ``lib/backends.py``    chain descriptors + "will use" prediction
- U3 ``lib/prescriptions.py`` the single remediation vocabulary
- ``lib/pipeline.diagnose`` + ``lib/permission_preflight`` for the
  engine-level availability and permission summary

The legacy ``--diagnose`` / ``--preflight`` flags keep their frozen JSON
shapes (see ``tests/test_diagnose_compat.py``); anything new appears ONLY
in ``doctor --json``.

Tier rollup (the R1 machine contract). Per source, ``tier`` is the
four-value rollup and ``status`` preserves the most specific state:

| condition                                            | status        | tier  |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| probes pass, credentials (if any) present            | ok            | ok    |
| usable but degraded (fallback serving, partial)      | degraded      | warn  |
| opt-in not enabled / key-gated unconfigured          | opt-in /      | off   |
|                                                      | unconfigured  |       |
| configured but missing / broken / timeout / error    | that status   | error |

Semantics and guarantees:

- ``active_backend`` is a PREDICTION ("will use"), never an observation
  (KTD 4). Reddit is conditional mode: honest wording, no single winner.
- On a native-search host with no web keys, engine-side web search is
  intentionally off — doctor reports tier ``off`` with a host-native note,
  never a false-alarm error. Web search has NO env pin, only the
  ``--web-backend`` flag; the record says so.
- No cookie reads (plan-only, like ``--diagnose``); no secret values
  anywhere — key presence is booleans only.
- Per-source exception isolation: one failing probe becomes that source's
  ``error`` record; it can never blank the report.
- Reporting problems is a successful run: the exit code is always 0.
