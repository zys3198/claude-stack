## WHEN USER RESPONDS

**Read their response and match the intent:**

- If they ask a **QUESTION** about the topic → Answer from your research (no new searches, no prompt)
- If they ask to **GO DEEPER** on a subtopic → Elaborate using your research findings
- If they describe something they want to **CREATE** → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they ask for a **PROMPT** explicitly → Write ONE perfect prompt (see below)
- If they say **"more fun"**, **"too serious"**, or similar → Write `FUN_LEVEL=high` to `~/.config/last30days/.env` (append, don't overwrite). Confirm: "Fun level set to high. Next run will surface more witty and viral content."
- If they say **"less fun"**, **"too many jokes"**, or similar → Write `FUN_LEVEL=low` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "Fun level set to low. Next run will focus on the news."
- If they say **"register exec"**, **"register dev"**, **"register creator"**, or **"register default"** after a run → Re-synthesize the current research in that register immediately; do not fetch sources again and do not treat the phrase as a new topic. If they ask to keep it for future runs, append `LAST30DAYS_REGISTER={name}` to `~/.config/last30days/.env` (never overwrite the file).
- If they say **"eli5 on"**, **"eli5 mode"**, **"explain simpler"**, or similar → Treat it as `register eli5`: append `LAST30DAYS_REGISTER=eli5` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`, then re-synthesize the current research immediately using the ELI5 guidance without fetching again. Confirm: "ELI5 mode on. All future runs will explain things like you're 5."
- If they say **"eli5 off"**, **"normal mode"**, **"full detail"**, or similar → Append `LAST30DAYS_REGISTER=default` to `~/.config/last30days/.env`. Confirm: "ELI5 mode off. Back to full detail."
- If they say **"drill into 3"**, **"go deeper on cluster 3"**, **"drill into the OpenClaw API ban discussion"**, or similar after a run → invoke the engine with `python3 scripts/last30days.py --drill "<their target>"`. The engine resolves a 1-based cluster number or fuzzy title/entity description from the fresh `last-report.json` cache, re-researches only that cluster's contributing sources at deep depth, merges/dedupes the new evidence, and updates the cache so another drill can follow. Relay the rendered **Original / Deeper** brief. If the cache is absent or expired, tell them to run a normal `/last30days <topic>` research pass first.
- If they say **"verify freshness"**, **"check whether those facts are still current"**, or ask to gate action on current claims after a run → invoke `python3 scripts/last30days.py --verify-freshness` with no topic. It loads the fresh report cache, point-refetches only supported grounded data, updates the cached verdicts, and renders the compact Freshness Verification table. For a first-pass request, translate the intent into the normal engine invocation plus `--verify-freshness`. `LAST30DAYS_VERIFY_FRESHNESS=on` makes verification the default for topic runs; it does not turn a topic-less engine invocation into an implicit cache read.
- If they say **"mark <topic> as covered"**, **"I covered X on the podcast"**, **"we published that article"**, or similar → invoke the engine with `python3 scripts/last30days.py queue cover "<topic name>" --save-dir="${LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR}"` (same `--save-dir` scoping as discovery runs - queue rows live in that directory's research.db). Covering requires the exact queued topic name; on an unknown name the engine exits 2 and points at `queue list` - relay that, run `queue list`, and offer the queued names instead of retrying with guesses.
- If they say **"what's in my topic queue"**, **"what should I talk about next"**, **"show my content pipeline"**, or similar → invoke `python3 scripts/last30days.py queue list --save-dir="${LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR}"` and relay the rendered list (uncovered surfaced topics with domain, surface count, and last-surfaced date). An empty queue is a valid answer - suggest a `/last30days trending` or domain discovery run to populate it. (These two bullets cover the in-session case, after a run is already in context. The same asks arriving cold - with no research run yet this session - are handled by the TOPIC QUEUE FAST PATH near the top of this file, which runs the identical commands directly instead of falling into topic research.)

The user-facing slash interaction is natural language (`drill into N`), not a slash command with shell syntax. `--drill` is the direct-engine flag the hosting model translates that intent into; do not tell users to append pipes or engine flags to `/last30days`.

**Only write a prompt when the user wants one.** Don't force a prompt on someone who asked "what could happen next with Iran."

### Writing a Prompt

When the user wants a prompt, write a **single, highly-tailored prompt** using your research expertise.

### CRITICAL: Match the FORMAT the research recommends

**If research says to use a specific prompt FORMAT, YOU MUST USE THAT FORMAT.**

**ANTI-PATTERN**: Research says "use JSON prompts with device specs" but you write plain prose. This defeats the entire purpose of the research.

### Quality Checklist (run before delivering):
- [ ] **FORMAT MATCHES RESEARCH** - If research said JSON/structured/etc, prompt IS that format
- [ ] Directly addresses what the user said they want to create
- [ ] Uses specific patterns/keywords discovered in research
- [ ] Ready to paste with zero edits (or minimal [PLACEHOLDERS] clearly marked)
- [ ] Appropriate length and style for TARGET_TOOL

### Output Format:

```
Here's your prompt for {TARGET_TOOL}:

---

[The actual prompt IN THE FORMAT THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDS]

---

This uses [brief 1-line explanation of what research insight you applied].
```

---

## IF USER ASKS FOR MORE OPTIONS

Only if they ask for alternatives or more prompts, provide 2-3 variations. Don't dump a prompt pack unless requested.

## AFTER EACH PROMPT: Stay in Expert Mode

After delivering a prompt, offer to write more:

> Want another prompt? Just tell me what you're creating next.
